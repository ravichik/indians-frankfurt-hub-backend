Also, write a detailed invitation letter mentioning your job, salary, and accommodation details. This really helps!`

They're based in Offenbach but deliver to Frankfurt. Price is reasonable - around ‚Ç¨10 per person for 50 guests. They also do live jalebi counter which kids love!`

For Indian expats, don't forget about DTAA (Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement) between India and Germany. You need to file Form 10F to avoid double taxation on Indian income.

I use WISO Steuer software (‚Ç¨35) - has English interface and specifically handles expat scenarios well. Got ‚Ç¨2000 refund last year just by claiming relocation expenses properly!`

2. **Cologne** (1.5 hours by ICE) - Amazing cathedral, great museums, and vibrant nightlife. Try the local K√∂lsch beer!

3. **Black Forest** (2 hours) - Perfect for nature lovers. We did the Triberg waterfalls and had authentic Black Forest cake.

Pro tip: Get the Quer-durchs-Land-Ticket for ‚Ç¨44 - unlimited regional train travel for up to 5 people on weekends!`

For flight deals, check Frankfurt Hahn airport (not just FRA). Got return tickets to Barcelona for ‚Ç¨40!`
